# Willemstad X (Extended)
Named after the capital of Curaçao (which is known for its colourful houses), the extended _Willemstad_ is a fully-fledged theme and extension of [the original _Willemstad_ snippet/theme variant proof-of-concept](https://github.com/tingmelvin/willemstad) for Chris Grieser (pseudometa)'s [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme, [Shimmering Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus). You can sponsor Chris [here](https://ko-fi.com/pseudometa)!

**NOTE!** Willemstad X is not supported for the legacy editor (CodeMirror 5), or for mobile. While mobile support might be coming in the longer future, you are advised only to use Willemstad X on desktop, and in the current default editor.

### Should I use this or Willemstad for Shimmering Focus?
It's up to you! I intend to maintain Willemstad for SF _without too much effort (read: not minimally, but almost minimally)_, since I don't think there are too many more features I'd like to add, or can add without conflicting with Shimmering Focus' base options. I don't want to conflict too many changes with Shimmering Focus as well! But if you are a power user and use most of Shimmering Focus's stuff, I'd suggest you stay with Shimmering Focus. Chris is way better/faster at doing CSS stuff than I am, too!

Willemstad for SF got featured in [Eleanor's roundup](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/2022-02-05/) (_yes, **the** Roundup_), so if that's the deciding factor, then go for that!

⚠️ Almost all UI styling (sans modals) that are present in Willemstad X, are not in Willemstad for SF. Willemstad X also encodes the DM family of fonts and Manrope, but this is not included in the Willemstad for SF files.

### Why is Inter embedded into Willemstad X, isn't that included in Obsidian proper?
Yes, it is. Inter is included in Obsidian proper. However, most people will download Inter onto their computers, and Obsidian [will use the font with the name that is present in your computer](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/Guides/Best+Practices+and+Tips+for+Theme+Development). Moreover, most people (**including myself**) download/-s/-ed Inter from Google Fonts, [which is probably the most outdated version you can get of the font](https://github.com/rsms/inter#alternate-distributions). (No proper _italics_, need I say more?!) By embedding Inter, alongside the other fonts, allows me to quality control and ensure the quality of your experience.

### Supported Community Plugins
Like Primary, Willemstad aims to get the core features right before delving into plugins. However, I totally agree that some plugins are almost essential to the Obsidian experience, and they were my daily drivers too, so they got some love here.
1. Style Settings
2. Calendar
3. Sliding Panes
4. Admonitions
5. Dataview
7. Breadcrumbs
8. Get Info
9. CookLang Plugin
10. Emoji Toolbar
11. Maps of Content
12. cMenu
13. Footnote & Citation Indicator
14. Longform

The community plugins I have an intention to support can also be seen [here](https://notes.tingmelvin.com/ER-Resources/ER2OWS/ER2OWS-12-CodingNomenclature_WillemstadX).

### Things to complete + WIP
1. Colour Palettes (revamping the Oxford one from Willemstad SF, and creating the Le Corbusier Colour Keyboard one)
2. Adding support for `writing` cssClass from Shimmering Focus
3. ~~Adding support for Minimal Cards from [Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal)~~
4. Fixes for mobile (albeit not offering official support yet)
5. ... and a bunch of other stuff in my Obsidian file that I didn't write it here. However, most of what I have in mind can be found [here](https://notes.tingmelvin.com/ER-Resources/ER2OWS/ER2OWS-13-ThingsToDo_WillemstadX), although obviously it's not neat in any sense of the word.
6. Theme Documentation

### Just another word
Having a theme out within 2.5 weeks of trying to do something with CSS (from the time I left [Sanctum](https://github.com/jdanielmourao/obsidian-sanctum), which I honestly think [jdaniel](https://github.com/jdanielmourao) did an amazing job with) is probably something I didn't think was possible even a week before this was published.
That being said, [Chris](https://github.com/chrisgrieser) (of [Shimmering Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus) fame), [Cecilia](https://github.com/ceciliamay) (of [Primary](https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary) fame), and [SlRvB](https://github.com/SlRvb) (of [ITS Theme](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme) fame) prophesied I would end up with a theme and had more faith in me than I did. I owe them a word of thanks. Thanks y'all, and I hope I didn't let anyone of you down. :blush:

### Attribution
As is with most theme codes in Obsidian, many pieces/snippets of code have been cobbled together from whatever the hive mind has created. It is therefore not possible to accurately and fully attribute everyone's efforts, which might have come into and been adopted by this theme. That being said, there are multiple pieces of instrumental code that I can attribute to, which I do so here:
- Multi-Colour Highlighting, adapted from [Zhang Chenyu (@Atlas)](https://github.com/zcysxy) and [Chris Grieser (@pseudometa)](https://github.com/chrisgrieser)
- Varying/Readable Underlines, co-written by myself and [Cecilia May](https://github.com/ceciliamay)
- Dataview Word Wraps, from [SlRvB](https://github.com/SlRvb)
- No-Shadow Sliding Panes, with input from [Damian Korcz](https://github.com/damiankorcz)
- No-Shadow Admonitions, inspired by Leah's lamentations to [Jeremy Valentine](https://github.com/valentine195)
- and many other snippets that were written by [Chris Grieser](https://github.com/chrisgrieser)
