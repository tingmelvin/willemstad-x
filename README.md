> Note 2 (2025-06-12): The rewrite is ongoing as a byproduct of another work I'm doing that necessitates the use of Obsidian. Once this is done, this will be uploaded here. 
> Please note: Willemstad is currently undergoing a rewrite (from ground-up) for Obsidian 1.0, and the look and feel might be somewhat materially different from now. The UI from current alpha-version available in the Community Store right now will remain.

The theme documentation is available [here](https://willemstad.cc/). 

# Willemstad
Named after the capital of Cura√ßao (which is known for its colourful houses), the extended _Willemstad_ is a fully-fledged theme and extension of [the original _Willemstad_ snippet/theme variant proof-of-concept](https://github.com/tingmelvin/willemstad) for Chris Grieser (pseudometa)'s [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme, [Shimmering Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus). You can sponsor Chris [here](https://ko-fi.com/pseudometa)!

**To use**:

For the most current version, use the Community Theme store in Obsidian. __(this is the preferred and recommended method!)__ 

Alternatively, download the release, and drop `obsidian.css` into your `.obsidian\themes` folder in the vault you wish to have the theme in.

### Why is Inter embedded into Willemstad X, isn't that included in Obsidian proper?
Yes, it is. Inter is included in Obsidian proper. However, most people will download Inter onto their computers, and Obsidian [will use the font with the name that is present in your computer](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/Guides/Best+Practices+and+Tips+for+Theme+Development). Moreover, most people (**including myself**) download/-s/-ed Inter from Google Fonts, [which is probably the most outdated version you can get of the font](https://github.com/rsms/inter#alternate-distributions). (No proper _italics_, need I say more?!) By embedding Inter, alongside the other fonts, allows me to quality control and ensure the quality of your experience.

### I'd like to change something or propose something. What's the easiest way to do so?
If it's something you reckon people would need/want as well, the easiest way to request changes is to use the Issues tab here on GitHub. If you would like to change something that you can reckon you rather do it yourself, the best way would be to use a snippet.

## Supported Community Plugins
Please refer to the [Willemstad theme documentation](https://willemstad.cc).

## Attribution
As is with most theme codes in Obsidian, many pieces/snippets of code have been cobbled together from whatever the hive mind has created. It is therefore not possible to accurately and fully attribute everyone's efforts, which might have come into and been adopted by this theme. That being said, there are multiple pieces of instrumental code that I can attribute to, which I do so here:
- Multi-Colour Highlighting, adapted from [Zhang Chenyu (@Atlas)](https://github.com/zcysxy)'s and [Chris Grieser (@pseudometa)](https://github.com/chrisgrieser)'s code
- Varying/Readable Underlines, co-written by myself and [Cecilia May](https://github.com/ceciliamay)
- Dataview Word Wraps, from [SlRvB](https://github.com/SlRvb)
- No-Shadow Sliding Panes, with input from [Damian Korcz](https://github.com/damiankorcz)
- No-Shadow Admonitions, inspired by Leah's lamentations to [Jeremy Valentine](https://github.com/valentine195)
- Longform plugin and `writing` cssclass support, adapted from [Chris Grieser (@pseudometa)](https://github.com/chrisgrieser)'s code, and also with credits to [Kevin Barrett (@kevboh)](https://github.com/kevboh/longform)'s [styling](https://github.com/kevboh/longform#scene-only-styling)
- and many other snippets that were written by [Chris Grieser](https://github.com/chrisgrieser)
- Nord theme colour palette, adapted from the original documentation written by [Sven Greb](https://github.com/svengreb)
- Minimal Cards and Image Grids, from [Stephan Ango](https://github.com/kepano)


## Theme Documentation (currently a work in progress)
Available [here](https://willemstad.cc), includes information on [callouts](https://willemstad.cc/Theme+Extensions/Callouts).

### Just another word
Having a theme out within 2.5 weeks of trying to do something with CSS (from the time I left [Sanctum](https://github.com/jdanielmourao/obsidian-sanctum), which I honestly think [jdaniel](https://github.com/jdanielmourao) did an amazing job with) is probably something I didn't think was possible even a week before this was published.
That being said, [Chris](https://github.com/chrisgrieser) (of [Shimmering Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus) fame), [Cecilia](https://github.com/ceciliamay) (of [Primary](https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary) fame), and [SlRvB](https://github.com/SlRvb) (of [ITS Theme](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme) fame) prophesied I would end up with a theme and had more faith in me than I did. I owe them a word of thanks. Thanks y'all, and I hope I didn't let anyone of you down. :blush:

As is permissible under the original TOS as is the case with Obsidian, most of its constituent snippets (CSSClass, code written in conjunction with, or by other developers) and components that are licensed under the terms of the MIT license or another license, either by myself or its respective authors remain as is, and you will obtain a source copy of the full code in the GitHub repository. However, all rights are reserved to prevent further misuse of Willemstad which has occured pre-1.0.

Willemstad remains forever free (free as in free beer, not free libre/free will), but cannot be considered open-source in the strictest definition of the term.
