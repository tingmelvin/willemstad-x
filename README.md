# Willemstad X (Extended)
Named after the capital of Curaçao (which is known for its colourful houses), the extended _Willemstad_ is a fully-fledged theme and extension of [the original _Willemstad_ snippet/theme variant proof-of-concept](https://github.com/tingmelvin/willemstad) for Chris Grieser (pseudometa)'s [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme, [Shimmering Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus). You can sponsor Chris [here](https://ko-fi.com/pseudometa)!

### Should I use this or Willemstad for Shimmering Focus?
It's up to you! I intend to maintain Willemstad for SF _without too much effort (read: not minimally, but almost minimally)_, since I don't think there are too many more features I'd like to add, or can add without conflicting with Shimmering Focus' base options. I don't want to conflict too many changes with Shimmering Focus as well! But if you are a power user and use most of Shimmering Focus's stuff, I'd suggest you stay with Shimmering Focus. Chris is way better/faster at doing CSS stuff than I am, too!

Willemstad for SF got featured in [Eleanor's roundup](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/2022-02-05/), so if that's the deciding factor, then go for that!

⚠️ Almost all UI styling (sans modals) that are present in Willemstad X, are not in Willemstad for SF. Willemstad X also encodes the DM family of fonts and Manrope, but this is not included in the Willemstad for SF files.

### Why is Inter embedded into Willemstad X, isn't that included in Obsidian proper?
Yes, it is. Inter is included in Obsidian proper. However, most people will download Inter onto their computers, and Obsidian [will use the font with the name that is present in your computer](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/Guides/Best+Practices+and+Tips+for+Theme+Development). Moreover, most people (**including myself**) download/-s/-ed Inter from Google Fonts, [which is probably the most outdated version you can get of the font](https://github.com/rsms/inter#alternate-distributions). (No proper _italics_, need I say more?!) By embedding Inter, alongside the other fonts, allows me to quality control and ensure the quality of your experience.

### Things to complete + WIP
1. adding multiple highlighting
2. ... and a bunch of other stuff in my Obsidian file that I didn't write it here. However, most of what I have in mind can be found [here](https://notes.tingmelvin.com/ER-Resources/ER2OWS/ER2OWS-13-ThingsToDo_WillemstadX), although obviously it's not neat in any sense of the word.
