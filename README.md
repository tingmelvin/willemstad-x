# Willemstad X (Extended)
Named after the capital of Curaçao (which is known for its colourful houses), the extended _Willemstad_ is a fully-fledged theme and extension of the original _Willemstad_ snippet/theme variant proof-of-concept for Chris Grieser (pseudometa)'s [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme, [Shimmering Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus). You can sponsor Chris [here](https://ko-fi.com/pseudometa)!

## Should I use this or Willemstad for Shimmering Focus?
It's up to you! I intend to maintain Willemstad for SF minimally, since I don't think there are too many more features I'd like to add. I don't want to conflict too many changes with Shimmering Focus as well! But if you are a power user and use most of Shimmering Focus's stuff, I'd suggest you stay. Chris is way better/faster at doing CSS stuff than I am, too!

Willemstad for SF got featured in [Eleanor's roundup](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/2022-02-05/), so if that's the deciding factor, then go for that!

⚠️ There are sidebar/sidedock and titlebar styling in Willemstad X than isn't present in Willemstad for SF!

## Things to complete
1. renaming `RGB` to `HSL`
2. ... and a bunch of other stuff in my Obsidian file that I didn't write it here
