‚ú® __Everything is new at this point!__
- Minimalistic **'Eclipse Tabs'** that allows you to access Settings (and everything in your sidebars) without them taking much space
- Two default font pairing choices ‚Äî *Manrope + DM Sans*, and *Inter* (which is also embedded into Willemstad X even though it's available in Obsidian core as most people have the Google Fonts version that does not render italics correctly)
- Settings (via *Style Settings* plugin) for header text + background colours, coloured YAML, readable underline spacing, modal widths, abovementioned Eclipse Tabs etc.
- Plugin Support for Calendar, Sliding Panes, Dataview, Admonitions, Breadcrumbs amongst others (Templater coming soon)
- Hidden tabs everywhere ‚Äî side pane tabs, and status bar, as well as the Eclipse sidebar tabs all are hidden/partially-hidden by default and can be accessed by hovering over them
- And most of the stuff originally available in Willemstad for Shimmering Focus!
