/* My colour policy is as follows:

1. col-accent (5 colours, in a gradient) - light one is 00 and dark is 20
2. a UI overall colour kinda thingamabob. the --background-primary, --background-secondary, and the alts
3. headers. can be same as 1., can be something else. see how you deem fit.
4. maybe main text? if you're doing something like Nord

KEEP THESE COMPONENTS SEPARATE (each one have their own system) AND YOU WILL BE FINE
